  abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of `best practice' when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. {\copyright} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The TRIPOD (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis) statement was published in 2015 to provide the minimum reporting recommendations for studies developing or evaluating the performance of a prediction model. Methodological advances in the field of prediction have since included the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) powered by machine learning methods to develop prediction models. An update to the TRIPOD statement is thus needed. TRIPOD+AI provides harmonised guidance for reporting prediction model studies, irrespective of whether regression modelling or machine learning methods have been used. The new checklist supersedes the TRIPOD 2015 checklist, which should no longer be used. This article describes the development of TRIPOD+AI and presents the expanded 27 item checklist with more detailed explanation of each reporting recommendation, and the TRIPOD+AI for Abstracts checklist. TRIPOD+AI aims to promote the complete, accurate, and transparent reporting of studies that develop a prediction model or evaluate its performance. Complete reporting will facilitate study appraisal, model evaluation, and model implementation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A secondary objective included a cost-benefit analysis of protocol use.           Methods~           In this retrospective chart review, we compared cohorts of patients treated in our ED for acute asthma exacerbation before and after implementation of a CNA protocol. Patients between the ages of 2 and 21 years seen between March 1 and May 31, 2008 (preprotocol, n = 393), and March 1 to May 31, 2009 (postprotocol, n = 373), were included. Safety data included medication-related adverse effects as well as serum potassium and glucose levels. Efficacy data included ED length of stay, disposition, return visits, time to first albuterol treatment, and corticosteroid administration. Cost analysis included the cost of medications and respiratory therapy time.           Results~           Postprotocol patients more often received CNA (57.9\% vs 25.2\%, P {$<$} 0.01). No significant adverse effects, including tachyarrhythmia and symptomatic hypokalemia, were found in either group. Serum potassium levels were higher in the postprotocol group (3.9 mEq/L [n = 34] vs 3.5 mEq/L [n = 28], P {$<$} 0.01). Emergency department stay was longer in the postprotocol group (217.8 minutes vs 187.2 minutes, P {$<$} 0.01). Emergency department disposition was similar in both groups. The mean cost per patient was higher in the postprotocol group (\$327.21 vs \$277.95, P {$<$} 0.01).           Conclusions~           We found the CNA protocol to be safe. Superior efficacy to a traditional treatment approach was not demonstrated. The mean cost of treatment was higher in the postprotocol group. Further prospective studies should be conducted to confirm the findings of this retrospective, observational study.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Continuous nebulized albuterol is frequently used to treat children with status asthmaticus in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) but can have cardiovascular side effects. Limited data exist comparing different dosages. The purpose of this study was to compare hemodynamic side effects of two continuous albuterol doses (10 vs. 25 mg/h). Our hypothesis was that lower dose albuterol would be associated with lower toxicity without increased need for adjunctive therapies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children over 2 years old receiving continuous nebulized albuterol for status asthmaticus in our PICU from 2011 to 2013. Standard initial therapy was intravenous steroids and continuous nebulized albuterol. Patients receiving 10 mg/h albuterol were compared to those receiving 25 mg/h. Clinical outcomes, including the need for additional asthma therapies as well as hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation, were evaluated. Results: About 632 patients were studied (342 received 10 mg/h, 290 received 25 mg/h). Children in the lower-dose group received less fluid resuscitation without increased adjunctive therapies when adjusted for confounders. Those in the 25 mg/h group receiving 17\% higher bolus volume. Those receiving lower-dose albuterol had shorter adjusted PICU and hospital lengths of stay. Conclusions: In our PICU cohort of children with status asthmaticus, use of 10 mg/h continuous albuterol was associated with lower fluid bolus resuscitation without more adjunctive therapies. These findings support the safety of lower doses in this population. Prospective studies evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of specific continuous albuterol dosages in critically ill children with status asthmaticus are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a respiratory support device historically used in pediatrics for infants with bronchiolitis. No large-scale analysis has determined the current frequency or demographic distribution of HFNC use in children. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and correlates of HFNC use in children presenting to the hospital for asthma, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia. METHODS: This longitudinal observational study was based on electronic health record data from a large regional health information exchange, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC). Subjects were age 0-18 y with recorded hospital encounters at an INPC hospital between 2010-2019 with International Classification of Diseases codes for bronchiolitis, asthma, or pneumonia. Annual proportions of HFNC use among all hospital encounters were assessed using generalized additive models. Log-binomial regression models were used to identify correlates of incident HFNC use and determine risk ratios of specific subjects receiving HFNC. RESULTS: The study sample included 242,381 unique subjects with 412,712 hospital encounters between 2010-2019. The 10-y period prevalence of HFNC use was 2.54\% (6,155/242,381) involving 7,974 encounters. Hospital encounters utilizing HFNC increased by 400\%, from 326 in 2010 to 1,310 in 2019. This increase was evenly distributed across all 3 diagnostic categories (bronchiolitis, asthma, and pneumonia). Sex, race, age, and ethnicity all significantly influenced the risk of HFNC use. Over the 10-y period, the percentage of all hospital encounters using HFNC increased from 1.11\% in 2010 to 3.15\% in 2018. Subjects with multiple diagnoses had significantly higher risk of receiving HFNC. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HFNC in children presenting to the hospital with common respiratory diseases has increased substantially over the past decade and is no longer confined to treating infants with bronchiolitis. Demographic and diagnostic factors significantly influenced the frequency of HFNC use.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Continuous albuterol is a mainstay in management of pediatric status asthmaticus. While the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Asthma Guidelines suggest 0.5\,mg/kg/h as the recommended dosage, there is a paucity of evidence comparing different weight-based rates on hospital outcomes.Methods: Patients requiring continuous albuterol for asthma exacerbation from January 2015 to December 2016 were identified using ICD codes. The concentration of albuterol (5\,mg/h-20\,mg/h) and the duration of treatment were used to determine total albuterol administration. After dividing by patient weight, average weight-based doses were divided into equal quintiles. Unadjusted and length of stay adjusted for age, initial asthma severity score, and administration of magnesium were compared among the quintiles. The same multivariate analysis was used for duration of continuous albuterol.Results: Five hundred thirty-three hospitalizations for asthma were identified of which 289 received continuous albuterol. Weight-based dosage quintiles ranged from lowest (0.07-0.29\,mg/kg/h) to the highest ({$>$}0.76-3.2\,mg/kg/h). Baseline characteristics were similar aside from age, race, and magnesium administration. There was no difference in adjusted length of stay or adjusted duration of continuous albuterol therapy among the five quintiles.Conclusion: No optimal weight-based dose of continuous albuterol was found. Further investigation is needed to see if lower amounts of continuous albuterol may be as efficacious as higher doses. This could improve cost of status asthmaticus management and limit the number of adverse events associated with high exposure to continuous albuterol.},

We examined the effect of high-dose (75 or 150 mg/hr) albuterol on clinical variables in children with status asthmaticus. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of inpatient medical records and prospectively collected computerized PICU respiratory therapy database. SETTING: Twenty-five-bed multidisciplinary PICU in a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the PICU between January 2006 and December 2007 with status asthmaticus receiving high-dose continuous albuterol nebulization. (Those with cerebral palsy, cardiac pathology, and ventilator dependence were excluded.) INTERVENTIONS: : Chart review for PICU length of stay, albuterol dose, duration of nebulization, occurrence of chest pain, vomiting, tremors, hypokalemia (serum potassium {$<$} 3.0 mEq/L), and cardiac arrhythmia. Maximal heart rate, lowest diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were compared to the variables at initiation of therapy and at hospital discharge. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-two patients (22 boys and 20 girls) received high-dose continuous albuterol nebulization. Twenty-three received 75 mg/hr and 19 received 150 mg/hr (3.7 mg/kg/hr [interquartile range, 2.4-5.8 mg/kg/hr]) for a duration of 22.3 hours (interquartile range, 6.6-31.7 hr). Heart rate increased and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure were significantly lower during nebulization compared to initiation of therapy or at hospital discharge (p {$<$} 0.05). No patient required fluid resuscitation or inotropic support, and one had self-limited premature ventricular contractions. Hypokalemia occurred in five of 33 patients who had serum electrolytes measured but did not require supplementation. One patient required endotracheal intubation after initiation of nebulization, and seven patients (16.7\%) received noninvasive ventilation. PICU length of stay was 2.3 {\textpm} 1.7 days; there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose continuous albuterol nebulization is associated with a low rate of subsequent mechanical ventilation and fairly short PICU length of stay without significant toxicity. Prospective studies comparing conventional and high-dose albuterol nebulization are needed to determine the optimum dose providing maximum efficacy with the least adverse effects.},

  abstract = {Objective: Continuous nebulization is becoming more popular in the management of acute bronchospasm in the emergency department (ED). Controversy still exists as to the optimal dose of albuterol for such exacerbations. The present study hypothesis was that there is no difference between continuous nebulization of albuterol at 7.5 mg/hr (usual dose) and 15 mg/hr (high dose) in peak flow improvement up to three hours. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, set in an urban county teaching ED. One hundred twenty-seven patients with acute bronchospasm and an initial peak flow (PF) less than 75\% predicted were enrolled. Patients were randomized to usual-dose (UD) or high-dose (HD) groups along with a standard treatment protocol. Primary end-points were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) are given for such variables. Results: Sixty-seven patients were randomized to the HD albuterol group, and 63 completed the study. Sixty patients were randomized to the UD group, and 55 completed the study. Repeated-measures ANOVA found no difference in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, Borg dyspnea scale score, and peak flow over time between the groups. The mean ({\textpm}SD) peak flow improvement at one hour was UD 51 ({\textpm}49) L/min vs. HD 45 ({\textpm}50) L/min, mean difference 6.8 L/min (95\% CI = -11 to 24.9 L/min). Adjusting for baseline, the percentage increase in peak flow at one hour was UD 44\% ({\textpm}60\%) vs. HD 30\% ({\textpm}40\%), mean difference 14\% (95\% CI = -4.4\% to 32.4\%). Time to disposition showed a mean of 188 ({\textpm}129) minutes for UD and 230 ({\textpm}183) minutes for HD, mean difference 42 minutes (95\% CI = -170 to 101 min). One patient in the HD group was intubated. Admission rate was UD 70.9\% vs. HD 65\%, mean difference 5.9\% (95\% CI = -10.9\% to 22.7\%). Conclusions: In treating acute, moderately-severe bronchospastic ED patients with peak flow less than 75\% of predicted with albuterol by continuous nebulization, 15 mg/hr appears to offer no advantage over 7.5 mg/hr in peak flow improvement or length of stay in the ED.},

  abstract = {We introduce the C++ application and R package ranger. The software is a fast implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.},
